    "Security logs are often stored in text files. To analyze the security logs in these files, security analysts have to import and parse these files. Python has some functions that come in handy for these tasks, allowing analysts to efficiently access information from text files. The lab focuses on using functions and other syntax in Python to import and parse text files. \n",
